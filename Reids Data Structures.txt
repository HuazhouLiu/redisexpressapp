Update with Redis
Redis will be used to store the most recent 10 changed orders
Redis Data Structures
I used the Redis Lists to record recently added or edited orders
key = “cache:orders”
value = {
order_date: order_date (“order:id:order_date”),
total_amount: total_amount(“order:id:total_amount”),
customer_id: customer_id(“order:id:customer_id”),
}
